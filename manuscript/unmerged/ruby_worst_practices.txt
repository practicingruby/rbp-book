== Appendix C: Ruby Worst Practices ==

If you've read through most of this book, you'll notice that it didn't have much
of a "Do this, not that" theme.  Ruby as a language doesn't fit well into that
framework, since there are always exceptions to any rule you can come up with.

However, there are certainly a few things you really shouldn't do, unless you
know exactly why you are doing them.   This appendix is meant to cover a handful
of those scenarios and show you some better alternatives.  I've done my best to
stick to issues I've been bit by myself, in the hopes that I can offer some
practical advice for problems you might actually have run into.

A bad practice in programming shouldn't be simply defined by some ill-defined
aesthetic imposed upon folks by the "experts".  Instead, we can often track
anti-patterns in code down to either flaws in the high level design of an object
oriented system, or failed attempts at cleverness in the underlying
feature implementations.  These bits of unsavory code produced by bad habits or
the misunderstanding of certain Ruby peculiarties can be a drag on your whole
project, creating substantial technical debt as they accumulate.

We'll start with the high level design issues and then move on to the common
sticking points when implementing tricky Ruby features.  Making an improvement
to even a couple of these problem areas will make a major difference, so even if
you already know about most of these pitfalls, you might find one or two tips that
will go a long way.

=== Not-so Intelligent Design ===

Well designed object oriented systems can be a dream to work with.  When every
component seems to fit together nicely, with clear, simple integration code
between the major subsystems, you get the feeling that the architecture is
working for you, and not against you.

If you're not careful, all of this can come crashing down.  Let's look at a few
things to watch out for, and how to get around them.

==== Class Variables Considered Harmful ====

Ruby's class variables are one of the easiest ways to break encapsulation and
create headaches for yourself when designing class heirarchies.  To demonstrate the
problem, I'll show an example where class variables were tempting but ultimately
the wrong solution.

In my abstract formatting library +Fatty+, I provide a formatter base class
which users must inherit from from to make use of the system.  This provides
helpers which build up anonymous classes for certain formats.   To get a sense
of what this looks like, take a look at this example:

..............................................................................

class Hello < FattyRBP::Formatter 
  format :text do
    def render
      "Hello World"
    end
  end

  format :html do
    def render
      "<b>Hello World</b>"
    end
  end
end

puts Hello.render(:text) #=> "Hello World"
puts Hello.render(:html) #=> "<b>Hello World</b>"

..................................................................................

Though we've omitted most of the actual functionality +Fatty+ provides, a simple
implementation of this system using class variables might look like this:

..................................................................................

module FattyRBP
  class Formatter
     @@formats = {}

     def self.format(name, options={}, &block)
       @@formats[name] = Class.new(FattyRBP::Format, &block)
     end

     def self.render(format, options={})
       @@formats[format].new(options).render
     end
   end

  class Format
    def initialize(options)
      # not important
    end

    def render
      raise NotImplementedError
    end
  end 

end

..................................................................................

This code will make the example we showed earlier work as advertised.  Now let's
see what happens when we add another subclass into the mix.

..................................................................................

class Goodbye < FattyRBP::Formatter
  format :text do
    def render
      "Goodbye Cruel World!"
    end
  end
end

puts Goodbye.render(:text) #=> "Goodbye Cruel World!"

..................................................................................

At a first glance, things seem to be working.  But if we dig deeper, we see two
problems:

..................................................................................

# Should not have changed
puts Hello.render(:text) #=> "Goodbye Cruel World!" 

# Shouldn't exist
puts Goodbye.render(:html) #=> "<b>Hello World</b>"

..................................................................................

And here, we see the problem with class variables.  If we think of them as
class-level state, we'd be wrong.  They are actually class-heirarchy variables
that can have their state modified by any subclass, whether direct or many
levels down the ancestry chain.  This means they're fairly close to
global state in nature, which is usually a bad thing.  So unless you were
actually counting on this behavior, an easy fix is to just dump class variables
and use class instance variables instead.

..................................................................................

module FattyRBP
  class Formatter

    def self.formats
      @formats ||= {}
    end

     def self.format(name, options={}, &block)
       formats[name] = Class.new(FattyRBP::Format, &block)
     end

     def self.render(format, options={})
       formats[format].new(options).render
     end
   end

  class Format
    def initialize(options)
      # not important
    end
  end
end

..................................................................................

Although this prevents direct access to the variable from instances, it is easy
to define accessors at the class level.  The benefit is that each subclass
carries their own instance variable, just like ordinary objects do.  With this
new code, everything works as expected:

..................................................................................

puts Hello.render(:text)   #=> "Hello World"
puts Hello.render(:html)   #=> "<b>Hello World</b>"
puts Goodbye.render(:text) #=> "Goodbye Cruel World"

puts Hello.render(:text)   #=> "Hello World"
puts Goodbye.render(:html) #=> raises an error

..................................................................................

So the moral of the story here is that class-level state should be stored in
class instance variables if you want to allow subclassing.  Reserve class
variables for data that needs to be shared across an entire class heirarchy.

==== Hardcoding Yourself into a Corner ====

One good practice is to provide alternative constructors for your classes when
there are common configurations that might be generally useful.   One such
example is in +Prawn+, when a user wants to build up a document via a simplified
interface and then immediately render it to file:

..................................................................................

Prawn::Document.generate("hello.pdf") do
  text "Hello Prawn!"
end

..................................................................................

Implementing this method was very simple, as it simply wraps the constructor and
calls an extra method to render the file afterwards:

..................................................................................

module Prawn
  class Document

    def self.generate(filename,options={},&block)
      pdf = Prawn::Document.new(options,&block)          
      pdf.render_file(filename)
    end

  end
end

..................................................................................

However, some months down the line, a bug report made me realize that I made
somewhat stupid mistake here.  I accidentally prevented users from being able to 
write code like this:

..................................................................................

class MyDocument < Prawn::Document
  def say_hello
    text "Hello MyDocument"
  end
end

MyDocument.generate("hello.pdf") do
  say_hello
end

..................................................................................

The problem of course, is that +Prawn::Document.generate+ hard codes the
constructor call, which prevents subclasses from ever being instantiated via
+generate+.   The fix is so easy, it is somewhat embarassing to share:

..................................................................................

module Prawn
  class Document

    def self.generate(filename,options={},&block)
      pdf = new(options,&block)          
      pdf.render_file(filename)
    end

  end
end

..................................................................................

By removing the explicit receiver, we now construct an object based on whatever
+self+ is, rather than only building up +Prawn::Document+ objects.  This affords
us additional flexibility at virtually no cost.  In fact, because hardcoding the
name of the current class in your method definitions is almost always an
accident, this applies across the board as a good habit to get into.

Although much less severe, the same thing goes for class method definitions as
well.  Throughout this book, you will see class methods defined using
+def self.my_method+ rather than +def MyClass.my_method+.  The reason for this
is much more about maintainability than it is about style.  To illustrate this,
let's do a simple comparison.  We start off with two boring class definitions
for the classes +A+ and +B+

..................................................................................

  class A
    def self.foo
      # ..
    end

    def self.bar
      # ..
    end
  end

  class B
    def B.foo
      # ...
    end

    def B.bar
      # ...
    end
  end

..................................................................................

These two are functionally equivalent, each defining the class methods +foo+ and
+bar+ on their respective classes.  But now, let's refactor our code a bit, 
renaming +A+ to +C+ and +B+ to +D+. Observe the work involved in doing each:

..................................................................................

  class C 
    def self.foo
      # ..
    end

    def self.bar
      # ..
    end
  end

  class D 
    def D.foo
      # ...
    end

    def D.bar
      # ...
    end
  end


..................................................................................

To rename +A+ to +C+, we simply change the name of our class, and we don't need
to touch the method definitions.  But when we change +B+ to +D+, each and every
method needs to be reworked.  While this might be okay for an object with one or
two methods at the class level, you can imagine how tedious this could be when
that number gets larger. 

So we've now found two points against hardcoding class names, and could probably 
keep growing the list if we wanted.  But for now, let's move on to some higher
level design issues.

==== When Inheritence Becomes Restrictive ====

Inheritence is very nice when your classes have a clear hierarchical
structure between them.  However, it can get in the way when used
inappropriately.  Problems begin to crop up when we try to model cross-cutting
concerns using ordinary inheritance.   For examples of this, it's easy to look
directly into core Ruby.

Imagine if +Comparable+ were a class instead of a module.  Then, you would be
writing code like this:

..................................................................................

class Person < Comparable

  def initialize(first_name, last_name)
    @first_name = first_name
    @last_name  = last_name
  end

  attr_reader :first_name, :last_name

  def <=>(other_person)
    [last_name, first_name] <=> [other_person.last_name, other_person.first_name]
  end

end

..................................................................................

However, after seeing this, it becomes clear that it'd be nice to use a +Struct+
here.   If we ignore the features provided by +Comparable+ here for a moment,
the benefits of a struct to represent this simple data structure becomes
obvious.

..................................................................................

class Person < Struct.new(:first_name, :last_name)
  def full_name
    "#{first_name} #{last_name}"
  end
end

..................................................................................

Because Ruby supports single inheritance only, this example clearly
demonstrates the problems we run into when relying too heavily on hierarchical
structure.  A +Struct+ is certainly not always +Comparable+.   And it is just
plain silly to think of all +Comparable+ objects being +Struct+ objects.  The
key distinction here is that a +Struct+ defines what an object is made up of,
whereas +Comparable+ defines a set of features associated with certain objects.
For this reason, the real Ruby code to accomplish this modeling makes a whole
lot of sense:

..................................................................................

class Person < Struct.new(:first_name, :last_name)

  include Comparable

  def <=>(other_person)
    [last_name, first_name] <=> [other_person.last_name, other_person.first_name]
  end

  def full_name
     "#{first_name} #{last_name}"
  end

end

..................................................................................

Keep in mind that while we are constained to exactly one superclass, we can 
include as many modules as we'd like.  For this reason, modules are often used
to implement features that are completely orthogonal to the underlying class
definition they are mixed into.   Taking an example from the Ruby API
documentation, we see +Forwardable+ being used to very quickly implement a
simple +Queue+ structure by doing little more than delegating to an underlying
+Array+:

..................................................................................

require "forwardable"

class Queue
  extend Forwardable

  def initialize
    @q = [ ]    
  end

  def_delegator :@q, :push, :enq
  def_delegator :@q, :shift, :deq

  def_delegators :@q, :clear, :first, :push, :shift, :size
end

..................................................................................

Although +Forwardable+ would make no sense anywhere in a class hierarchy, it
accomplishes its task beautifully here.   If we were constrained to a purely
inheritance based model, such cleverness would not be so easy to pull off.

The key thing to remember here is not that you should avoid inheritance at all
cost, by any means.  Instead, you should simply remember not to go out of your
way to construct an artificial hierarchical structure to represent cross-cutting
or orthogonal concerns.  It's important to remember that Ruby's core is not
special or magical in its abundant use of mix ins, but instead, representative
of a very pragmatic and powerful object model.  You can and should apply this
technique within your own designs, whenever it makes sense to do so.

=== The Downside of Cleverness ===

Ruby lets you do all sorts of clever, fancy tricks.  This cleverness is a big
part of what makes Ruby so elegant, but it also can be downright dangerous in
the wrong hands. To illustrate this, we'll look at the kind of trouble you can
get in if you aren't careful.

==== The evils of +eval()+ ====

Throughout this book, we've dynamically evaluated code blocks all over the
place.  However, what you have not seen much of is the use of +eval()+, 
+class_eval()+, or even +instance_eval()+ with a string.  Some might wonder why 
this is, because `eval()` can be so useful!  For example, imagine that you are exposing 
a way for users to filter through some data.  You would like to be able to support an
interface like this:

..................................................................................

user1 = User.new("Gregory Brown", balance: 2500)
user2 = User.new("Arthur Brown", balance: 3300)
user3 = User.new("Steven Brown", balance: 3200)

f = Filter.new([user1, user2, user3])
f.search("balance > 3000") #=> [user2, user3]

..................................................................................

Armed with +instance_eval+, this task is so easy that you barely bat an eye as you
type out the following code:

................................................................................

class User
  def initialize(name, options)
    @name    = name
    @balance = options[:balance]
  end

  attr_reader :name, :balance
end

class Filter
  def initialize(enum)
    @collection = enum
  end

  def search(query)
    @collection.select { |e| e.instance_eval(query) }
  end
end

................................................................................

Running the earlier example, you see this code works great, exactly as expected.
But unfortunately, trouble strikes when you see queries like this:

................................................................................

>> f.search("@balance = 0")
=> [#<User:0x40caa4 @name="Gregory Brown", @balance=0>, 
    #<User:0x409138 @name="Arthur Brown", @balance=0>, 
    #<User:0x402874 @name="Steven Brown", @balance=0>]

................................................................................

Or perhaps even scarier:

................................................................................

>> f.search("system('touch hacked')")
=> [#<User:0x40caa4 @name="Gregory Brown", ...]
>> File.exist?('hacked')
=> true

................................................................................

Since the ability for user generated strings to execute arbitrary system
commands or damage the internals of an object aren't exactly appealing, you code
up a regex filter to protect against this:

................................................................................

def search(query)
  raise "Invalid query" unless query =~ /^(\w+) ([><!]=?|==) (\d+)$/
  @collection.select { |e| e.instance_eval(query) }
end

................................................................................

This protects against the two issues we saw before, which is great:

................................................................................

>> f.search("system('touch hacked')")
RuntimeError: Invalid query
	from (irb):33:in `search'
	from (irb):38
	from /Users/sandal/lib/ruby19_1/bin/irb:12:in `<main>'

>> f.search("@balance = 0")
RuntimeError: Invalid query
	from (irb):33:in `search'
	from (irb):39
	from /Users/sandal/lib/ruby19_1/bin/irb:12:in `<main>'

................................................................................

But if you weren't paying very close attention, you would have missed that we
got our anchors wrong.  That means there's still a hole to be exploited here:

................................................................................

>> f.search("balance == 0\nsystem('touch hacked_again')")
=> [#<User:0x40caa4 @name="Gregory Brown", @balance=0  ...]
>> File.exist?('hacked_again')
=> true

................................................................................

Since our regex checked the first line and not the whole string, we were able to
sneak by the validation.   Arguably, if you're very careful, you could come up
with the right pattern and be reasonably safe.  But since you are already
validating the syntax, why play with fire?  We can re-write this code to
accomplish the same goals with none of the associated risks:

................................................................................

def search(query)
  data = query.match(/^(?<attr>\w+) (?<op>[><!]=?|==) (?<val>\d+)$/)
  @collection.select do |e| 
    attr = e.public_send(data[:attr])
    attr.public_send(data[:op], Integer(data[:val])) 
  end
end

................................................................................

Here, we don't expose any of the objects internals, preserving encapsulation.
Because we parse out the individual components of the statement and use
+public_send+ to pass the messages on to our objects, we have completely
eliminated the possibility of arbitrary code execution.  All in all, this code
is much more secure and easier to debug.  As it turns out, this code will
actually perform considerably better as well.

Every time you use +eval(string)+, Ruby needs to fire up its parser and tree
walker to execute the code you've embedded in your string.  This means that in
cases in which you just need to process a few values and then do something with
them, using a targeted regular expression is often a much better option, as it 
greatly reduces the amount of work the interpreter needs to do.  

For virtually every need you might turn to a raw string +eval()+ for, you can
work around it using the tools Ruby provides.  These include all sorts of
methods for getting at whatever you need, including +instance_variable_get+, 
+instance_variable_set+, +const_get+, +const_set+, +public_send+, +send+, 
+define_method+, +method()+,and even +Class.new+ / +Module.new+.  These tools
allow you to dynamically manipulate Ruby code without evaluating strings directly. 
For more details, you'll definitely want to read the "Mastering the Dynamic Toolkit" 
chapter.

==== Blind +rescue+ missions ====
 
Ruby provides a lot of different ways to handle exceptions.  They run the gamut
all the way from capturing the full stack trace to completely ignoring raised
errors.  This flexibility means that exceptions aren't necessarily treated with
the same gravity in Ruby as in other languages, since they are very simple to
rescue once they are raised.   In certain cases, folks have even used +rescue+
as stand in replacement for conditional statements.  The classic example
follows: 

................................................................................

  name = @user.first_name.capitalize rescue "Anonymous"

................................................................................

Usually, this is done with the intention of capturing the +NoMethodError+ raised
by something like +first_name+ being nil here.  It accomplishes this task
well, and looks slightly nicer than the alternative:

................................................................................

  name = @user.first_name ? @user.first_name.capitalize : "Anonymous"

................................................................................

However, the downside of using this trick is that you will most likely end up
seeing this code again, at the long end of a painful debugging session.  For
demonstration purposes, let's assume our +User+ is implemented like this:

................................................................................
require "pstore"

class User

  def self.data
    @data ||= PStore.new("users.store")
  end

  def self.add(id, user_data)
    data.transaction do
      data[id] = user_data
    end
  end

  def self.find(id)
    data.transaction do
      data[id] or raise "User not found"
    end
  end
 
  def initialize(id)
    @user_id = id
  end

  def attributes
    self.class.find(@user_id)
  end

  def first_name
    attributes[:first_name]
  end

end

................................................................................

What we have here is basically a +PStore+ backed user database.  It's not terribly
important to understand every last detail, but the code should be fairly easy to
understand if you play around with it a bit.

Firing up irb we can see that the +rescue+ trick works fine for the case where
+User#first_name+ returns +nil+.  

................................................................................

>> require "user"
=> true

>> User.add('sandal', email: 'gregory@majesticseacreature.com')

=> {:email=>"gregory@majesticseacreature.com"}
>> @user = User.new('sandal')
=> #<User:0x48c448 @user_id="sandal">
>> name = @user.first_name.capitalize rescue "Anonymous"
=> "Anonymous"
=> #<User:0x49ab74 @user_id="sandal">
>> @user.first_name
=> nil
>> @user.attributes
=> {:email=>"gregory@majesticseacreature.com"}

................................................................................

Ordinary execution also works fine:

................................................................................

>> User.add('jia', first_name: "Jia", email: "jia@majesticseacreature.com")

=> {:first_name=>"Jia", :email=>"jia@majesticseacreature.com"}
>> @user = User.new('jia')
=> #<User:0x492154 @user_id="jia">
>> name = @user.first_name.capitalize rescue "Anonymous"
=> "Jia"
>> @user.attributes
=> {:first_name=>"Jia", :email=>"jia@majesticseacreature.com"}
>> @user.first_name
=> "Jia"
>> @user = User.new('sandal')

................................................................................

It seems like everything is in order, however, you don't need to look far.
Notice that this line will succeed even if +@user+ is undefined

................................................................................

>> @user = nil                                                                  
=> nil
>> name = @user.first_name.capitalize rescue "Anonymous"
=> "Anonymous"

................................................................................

This means you can't count on catching an error when a typo or a renamed
variable creeps into your code.   This weakness of course propagates down the
chain as well:

................................................................................

>> name = @user.a_fake_method.capitalize rescue "Anonymous"
=> "Anonymous"
>> name = @user.a_fake_method.cannot_fail rescue "Anonymous"
=> "Anonymous"

................................................................................

Of course, issues with a one liner like this should be easy enough to catch even
without an exception.  This is most likely the reason why this pattern has
become so common.   However, this is usually an oversight, because the problem
exists deeper down the bunny hole as well.  Let's introduce a typo into our user
implementation:

................................................................................

class User

  def first_name
    attribute[:first_name]
  end

end

................................................................................

Now, we go back and look at one of our previously working examples:

................................................................................

>> @user = User.new('jia')
=> #<User:0x4b8548 @user_id="jia">
>> name = @user.first_name.capitalize rescue "Anonymous"
=> "Anonymous"
>> @user.first_name
NameError: undefined local variable or method `attribute' for #<User:0x4b8548 @user_id="jia">
	from (irb):23:in `first_name'
	from (irb):32
	from /Users/sandal/lib/ruby19_1/bin/irb:12:in `<main>'

................................................................................

Hopefully you're beginning to see the picture.   Although good testing and
extensive quality assurance can catch these bugs, using this conditional
modifier +rescue+ hack is like putting blinders on your code.  Unfortunately,
this can also go for code of the form:

................................................................................

   def do_something_dangerous
      might_raise_an_error
   rescue
      "default value"
   end

................................................................................

Pretty much any rescue that does not capture a specific error may be a source of
silent failure in your applications.   The only real case where an unqualified
+rescue+ might make sense is when it is combined with a unqualified +raise+,
which causes the same error to resurface after executing some code:

................................................................................

   begin
     # do some stuff
   rescue => e
     MyLogger.error "Error doing stuff: #{e.message}"
     raise
   end 

................................................................................

In other situations, be sure to either know the risks involved, or avoid
this technique entirely.  You'll thank yourself later.

==== Doing +method_missing+ wrong ====

One thing you really don't want to do is mess up a +method_missing+ hook.
Because the purpose of +method_missing+ is to handle unknown messages, it is a
key feature for helping finding bugs in your code.

In the "Mastering the Dynamic Toolkit" chapter of this book, we covered some
examples of how to use +method_missing+ properly.  Here's an example of how to
do it wrong:

....................................................................................

class Prawn::Document

  # Provides the following shortcuts:
  #
  #    stroke_some_method(*args) #=> some_method(*args); stroke
  #    fill_some_method(*args) #=> some_method(*args); fill
  #    fill_and_stroke_some_method(*args) #=> some_method(*args); fill_and_stroke
  #
  def method_missing(id,*args,&block)
    case(id.to_s) 
    when /^fill_and_stroke_(.*)/
      send($1,*args,&block); fill_and_stroke
    when /^stroke_(.*)/
      send($1,*args,&block); stroke 
    when /^fill_(.*)/
      send($1,*args,&block); fill
    end
  end 

end

....................................................................................

Although this may look very similar to an earlier example in this book, it has a
critical flaw.  Can you see it?   If not, this irb session should help:

....................................................................................

>> pdf.fill_and_stroke_cirlce([100,100], :radius => 25)
=> "0.000 0.000 0.000 rg\n0.000 0.000 0.000 RG\nq\nb\n"
>> pdf.stroke_the_pretty_kitty([100,100], :radius => 25)
=> "0.000 0.000 0.000 rg\n0.000 0.000 0.000 RG\nq\nb\nS\n"
>> pdf.donuts
=> nil

....................................................................................

By coding a +method_missing+ hook without delegating to the original +Object+
definition, we have effectively muted our object's ability to complain about
messages we really didn't want it to handle.   To add insult to injury, failure
cases such as +fill_and_stroke_cirlce+ and +stroke_the_pretty_kitty+ are doubly
confusing, since they return a non-nil value even though they do not produce
meaningful results.

Luckily, the remedy to this is simple, we just add a call to +super+ in the
catch-all case:

....................................................................................

def method_missing(id,*args,&block)
  case(id.to_s) 
  when /^fill_and_stroke_(.*)/
    send($1,*args,&block); fill_and_stroke
  when /^stroke_(.*)/
    send($1,*args,&block); stroke 
  when /^fill_(.*)/
    send($1,*args,&block); fill
  else
    super
  end
end 

....................................................................................

Now, if we re-run our examples from before, you see much more predictable
behavior, in line with what we'd expect if we had no hook set up in the first
place:

....................................................................................

>> pdf.fill_and_stroke_cirlce([100,100], :radius => 25)
NoMethodError: undefined method `cirlce' for #<Prawn::Document:0x4e59f8>

....................................................................................

An important thing to remember is that in addition to ensuring that you call
+super+ from within your +method_missing()+ calls, you are also responsible for
maintaining the method's signature.  Ruby will happily allow you to write a hook
which only captures the name and not the arguments and block a method is called
with:

....................................................................................

def method_missing(id)
  # ...
end

....................................................................................

However, if you set things up this way, even when you call +super+ you'll be
breaking things farther up the chain, since +Object#method_missing+ expects the
whole signature of the function call to remain intact.  So it's not only
delegating to the original that is important, but delegating without information loss. 

If you're sure to act responsibly with your +method_missing+ calls, it won't be
that dangerous in most cases.  However, if you get sloppy here, it is virtually
guaranteed to come back to haunt you.  If you get into this habit right away,
it'll be sure to save you some headaches down the line.

=== Conclusions ===

This appendix doesn't come close to covering all the trouble you can get
yourself in with Ruby.  It does however cover some of the most common sources of
trouble and confusion, while showing some much less painful alternatives.

When it comes to design, much can be gained by simply reducing complexity.  If
the path you're on seems like it is too difficult, odds are it can be made a lot
easier if you just think about it in a different way.  As for "clever"
implementation tricks and shortcuts, they can be more trouble than they're worth
if they come at the expense of clarity or maintainability of your code.

Put simply, the worst practices in Ruby are ones that make you work much harder
than you have to.  If you start to introduce code that seems really cool at
first, but later is shown to introduce complicated faults at the corner cases,
it is generally wise to just rip it out and start fresh with something a little
less exciting that's more reliable.

If you maintain the balancing act between creative approaches to your problems
and ones that work without introducing excess complexity, you'll have a very
happy time writing Ruby code.  Because Ruby gives you the power to do both good
and evil, it's ultimately up to you how you want to maintain your projects.
However, code that is maintainable and predictable is much more of a joy to work
with than fragile and sloppy hacks that have been simply ductaped together.

Now that we have reached the very end of this book, I trust that you have the
skills necessary to go out and find the Best and Worst of Ruby Practices on your
own.  The real challenge is knowing the difference between the two, and that
ability comes only with practical experience gained by working on and
investigating real problems.  With luck, this book has included enough real
world examples to give you a head start in that area, but the heavy lifting needs to
be done by you.

I hope you have enjoyed this wild ride through Ruby with me, and I really hope
that something or the other in this book has challenged or inspired you.  Please
go out now and write some good open source Ruby code, and maybe you'll make a
guest appearance in the second edition!
